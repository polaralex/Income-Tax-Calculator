# Income-Tax-Calculator
A sample Tax Calculator, build in Java, to be used as a Code-Refactoring example.

This program was made as a Project for the Software Development 2 Class, taught in Computer Science dept. University of Ioannina.

It's a working example of using Java with Swing (for UI), a backend data-model and an XML-like Input/Output system. The code, also, maintains a high level of cleanliness, according to the most important Design Patterns in Java.

# How to Use:
1. When you first open the app, you should probably create some Person instances and give them basic data, such as name and income.
2. You can add as many people (Person objects) as you like.
3. For each Person, you can double-click on it, and add Receipts with their respective data.
4. Now, you can use "Export" from the Main Screen (with a Person selected) to export either a full XML file of the Person's data, or a simple Log file that contains a summary of information.
5. The XML export can be used as as data storage, since it can be imported using the Main Screen's "Import" button.
6. Also, every time you change something on a Person that's already been saved, the changes will cascade to the XML file.
